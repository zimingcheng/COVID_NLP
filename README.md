# Natural Language Processing Analyses on the Autobiographical Memory of COVID-19 From 2020 to 2022

Autobiographical memory, the recollection of personal experiences, has been a challenging area of study due to the inherent idiosyncrasy and subjectivity of individual memories.

This project addresses these challenges by focusing on a shared global experience: the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected narratives from participants across the globe, documenting their personal and collective experiences of the pandemic from 2020 to 2022. By focusing on a shared event, we aimed to reduce the idiosyncrasy inherent in autobiographical memory research, allowing for more robust comparisons between individuals and across time.

Furthermore, traditional methods often rely on qualitative analyses of interview data, which can be time-consuming and prone to researcher bias. Here, we innovatively employed computational natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the collected narratives. This approach brought several advantages:

* Objectivity: NLP methods provided an objective lens for analyzing the narratives, minimizing researcher bias.
* Scalability: Computational tools allowed us to analyze a large volume of data efficiently, which would have been impossible with traditional qualitative methods.
* Reproducibility: The use of standardized NLP techniques ensures the reproducibility of our findings, enhancing the rigor of the study.
* Efficiency: NLP methods significantly accelerated the analysis process, enabling us to gain insights more quickly.

By combining a shared global experience with computational NLP techniques, this project provides a novel and rigorous approach to studying autobiographical memory, opening new avenues for understanding how individuals remember and make sense of significant life events.
